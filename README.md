# Arduino System Monitor
- Clone as `arduino_system_monitor` for the Arduino IDE to be happy.
- Run `go_build.bat` or the command within it to build the exe.
- When the server is running, it'll have a clear system tray icon. Right
  clicking on this will allow you to quit the program.
- The server can (to some degree) handle the Arduino being reset, disconnected,
  or connected.
